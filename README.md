# Digital traversable wormhole tools

Simple tools that use Atsign's atSDK that feel like a digital traversable wormhole between machines

## Who is this for?

Anyone wanting some simple,private and secure ways to get data from one machine to another


### Contributor

This code is useful as a starting point for other tools or just to be used in thier own right.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is going to have the detailed guidance
on how to setup their tools, tests and how to make a pull request.

## Why, What, How?

### Why?

In DevSecOps we often need tools to get files like certificats or keys from one place to another

### What?

The code is written in Dart but the GitHub Action produces binaries for Mac/linux and Windows

### How?

To use the code/binaries

Get two atSigns from my.atsign.com
activate the atSigns using `at_activate`
twh_put/get allow the sending/receiving of a simple string
twh_pub/sub allow the sending/receiving of streams of strings




## Maintainers

Created by Colin Constable but on the shoulders of giants at Atsign
